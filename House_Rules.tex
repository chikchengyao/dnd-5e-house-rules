\chapter{Core Houserules}

\noindent [Version 7.4.4]

\section{How To Use}
The rules on this page are mandatory. Every other rule in this document is \textit{optional.} 

\subsubsection{Optional Rules}
Some optional rules provide mild benefits, while others can be self-imposed challenges. None are overly powerful or detrimental. 

All optional rules are designed such that choosing it affects only you, and no one else. So, you are free to use any combination of optional rules, or none of them.

\subsubsection{Sources and Balancing}
You can use any material from the official sourcebooks \see{sources}. Ask before using Unearthed Arcana or homebrew.

Balancing will be done on a case-by-case basis, when it seems necessary. 

\newpage
\section{Houserules}

\subsection{Base Ability Scores}
Use standard 27-point buy (PH, 13) for your ability scores. 

At 1st level, ability scores are capped at 17, after racial bonuses.

\subsection{Falling Unconscious}
If you fall unconscious from damage, you gain one level of exhaustion.

\subsection{Prone}
Standing from prone provokes opportunity attacks. Taking the Disengage action avoids this.
These opportunity attacks occur while still prone.

\subsection{Counterspell}
The spell "Counterspell" no longer exists. An optional alternative is available \see{counterspell}.

\subsection{Bonus Action Spells}
The rule on Bonus Action Spells (PH, 202) is simplified to: you can cast at most one levelled spell per turn.

\subsection{Warlocks}
Warlocks are based on Intelligence, not Charisma. Also, the Hexblade's Hex Warrior feature (XGE, 55) is transferred to the Pact of the Blade (PH, 107).










\chapter{Character Options}
\noindent You can opt to use any number of these for your own character.

\subsection{Simple HP Formula}
You can opt to use this formula, which is never lower than the standard formula.
\begin{itemize}
\item Your HP without class levels is 5.
\item For every class level, your HP increases by one hit die roll + CON mod. Reroll 1s. 
\item Instead of rolling, you can take the average, rounded up.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Intelligence Proficiencies}
For every +1 in your base Intelligence modifier (minimum 0), you can opt to learn one language and one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item learn one tool, or
    \item learn one Int, Wis or Cha skill, or
    \item double your proficiency in an Int skill.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Races}
You may swap your race's ability score increase for a +2/+1 increase to two different ability scores.

\subsection{Multiclassing}
Multiclassing (PH, 163) is allowed. 

When multiclassing into or from a Barbarian, Paladin or Ranger, you may use Strength instead of Dexterity (and vice versa) to fulfil the ability score minimum. 

\subsection{Backgrounds}
You can use custom backgrounds. Choose:
\begin{itemize}
\item any two skill proficiencies 
\item a total of two tool proficiencies or languages 
\item one equipment package from any background
\item one background feature from any background
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Feats}
Feats (PH, 165) are allowed, except Lucky and Savage Attacker.

\subsubsection{New Prerequisites}

\paragraph{Dwarven Fortitude} (XGE, 74) You no longer need to be a Dwarf.

\paragraph{Grappler} (PH, 167) You no longer need a Strength score of 13 or higher.

\paragraph{Ritual Caster} (PH, 169) You no longer need an Intelligence or Wisdom score of 13 or higher.

\paragraph{Magic Initiate, Ritual Caster, Spell Sniper} (PH, 168-170) You need 11 points or more in the spellcasting ability you choose.

\label{flavour-feats}
\subsection{Flavour Feats}
At level 1, and whenever you gain an Ability Score Increase from your class, you can opt to take one flavour feat from the table in the Appendix (\pg{flavour-feats-table}). Ignore ability score increases from flavour feats.

Flavour feats are not strong, but have good roleplaying potential and provide situational benefits.

\label{counterspell}
\subsection{Counterspell}
By the core houserules, the spell "Counterspell" no longer exists. If you are a bard, or a spellcaster who would originally have access to Counterspell, you can opt to gain this feature at the class level where you gain 3rd-level spells:

\subsubsection{Counterspell}
If you perceive a spell being cast, you automatically identify it, and can attempt to disrupt that triggering spell based on your knowledge of its school of magic, before it takes effect.

A counterspell is a spell from the same school as the triggering spell, which you know or have prepared. You cast your counterspell while adjusting it to disrupt the triggering spell, instead of producing its usual effect. Your counterspell can be cast using a reaction instead of its normal casting time, and requires its usual components, but does not consume them.

Because higher-levelled spells use techniques not found in simpler spells, your counterspell's base level cannot be lower than the triggering spell's base level. 

Make a spellcasting ability check against DC 10 + the triggering spell's level. You gain a bonus to this check equal to the level of the spell slot you used. Note that this check is usually made without proficiency.

If your counterspell is the same spell as the triggering spell, you gain advantage on this check, as less adjustment is needed. If your counterspell is cast at a lower level than the triggering spell, you have disadvantage on this check.

\subsection{Vancian Magic}
Prepared spellcasters can opt to be Vancian spellcasters, exchanging some spellcasting flexibility for limited access to their entire spell list.

\subsubsection{Preparing Spells}
Instead of preparing a list of spells, you prepare spells inside each of your spell slots. Whenever you complete a long rest or otherwise recover spell slots, choose a spell to occupy each slot. You can use a spell slot only to cast the spell occupying it, unless you take the Reprepare action (below) to change the occupying spell.

\begin{DndComment}{Example}
After completing a long rest, a 3rd-level Cleric who uses Vancian magic might have these spells prepared:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Bless}, \textit{Guiding Bolt}, and two \textit{Cure Wounds}, at 1st level.
\item \textit{Cure Wounds} and \textit{Inflict Wounds}, at 2nd level.
\end{itemize}

\noindent This cleric can cast Bless at 1st level, expending that spell. After doing so, her remaining prepared spells are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Guiding Bolt}, and two \textit{Cure Wounds}, at 1st level.
\item \textit{Cure Wounds} and \textit{Inflict Wounds}, at 2nd level.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Now, she can no longer cast Bless because she no longer has it prepared. 

Because Vancian casters can cast spells only at the level they were prepared, she can cast \textit{Guiding Bolt} only at 1st level, and \textit{Inflict Wounds} only at 2nd level.
\end{DndComment}

\subsubsection{Action: Reprepare}
You can use the Reprepare action a number of times equal to your level, recovering all expended uses on a long rest. You can reprepare a spell occupying a spell slot by taking the Reprepare action for a number of consecutive rounds equal to the slot's level. Repreparation is completed at the start of your turn on the round after your final Reprepare action. 

You choose the slot to reprepare and the new spell to occupy it when you take the first Reprepare action. You must concentrate on Reprepare until the repreparation is complete. If you do not take enough consecutive Reprepare actions, or your concentration is broken, the repreparation fails, wasting any expended uses of Reprepare.

If a feature says you have a spell "always prepared", using Reprepare to convert another spell to that spell does not count against your limit.


%If you normally have a spell "always prepared", you can convert any other prepared spell to that spell by concentrating for 1 minute per spell level.
%
%Arcane Recovery and Natural Recovery, instead of recovering expended spell slots, allows you to re-prepare spell slots with a combined level equal to or less than your level. You cannot re-prepare spells of 6th level or higher.

\chapter{Gameplay Options}
\noindent You can opt to use any number of these to modify your own gameplay.

\subsection{Proficiency Dice}
You can opt to use proficiency dice instead of a flat proficiency bonus (DMG, 263).

\subsection{Hit Dice}
This option gives you more precise control over healing from rests.

\subsubsection{Levelling}
You gain 2 hit dice per class level, instead of 1.

\subsubsection{Long Rests}
Long rests no longer automatically restore hit points. As a long rest ends, you can spend hit dice like in a short rest. Then, recover half your expended hit dice, rounded up.

\subsection{Encumbrance}
You can opt to track encumbrance as a self-imposed challenge. Use any of the three modes below.

\begin{DndTable}[header=Encumbrance (Normal)]{rX}
\textbf{Carried weight} & \textbf{Effect} \\
$\leq$ 15 $\times$ Strength & No penalty \\
$>$ 15 $\times$ Strength & Physically impossible \\
\end{DndTable}

\begin{DndTable}[header=Encumbrance (Hard)]{rX}
\textbf{Carried weight} & \textbf{Effect} \\
$\leq$ 5 $\times$ Strength & No penalty \\
$>$ 5 $\times$ Strength & Cannot travel at a fast pace \\
$>$ 10 $\times$ Strength & All speeds -10ft. \\
$>$ 15 $\times$ Strength & Physically impossible \\
\end{DndTable}

\begin{DndTable}[header=Encumbrance (Expert)]{rX}
\textbf{Carried weight} & \textbf{Effect} \\
$\leq$ 5 $\times$ Strength & No penalty \\
$>$ 5 $\times$ Strength & All speeds -10ft. \\
$>$ 10 $\times$ Strength & All speeds -20ft., disadvantage on physical checks, attacks and saves. \\
$>$ 15 $\times$ Strength & Physically impossible \\
\end{DndTable}
\subsection{Diagonal Grid Movement}
You can choose to move more realistically on a grid. Every second diagonal on a turn costs double (DMG, 252). Additionally, you have width while moving diagonally. 

\begin{DndComment}{Example}
Because you have width, if you step northeast you will also pass through the north and east grid squares. Therefore, you can't step diagonally if either of those squares are blocked, and you provoke opportunity attacks from both squares.
\end{DndComment}

\subsection{Critical Hits}
Whenever you make a critical hit, choose one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item maximise the dice (no uncertainty)
\item roll the dice twice (default)
\item roll once and double (high risk, high reward)
\end{itemize}

\label{gameplay-bonus-action}
\subsection{Action: Gain a Bonus Action}
You can exchange an action for a bonus action on your turn, but you cannot use bonus actions from the same feature more than once in a turn.

\begin{DndComment}{Example}
You can use your action to gain a second bonus action, then cast Healing Word with one bonus action and use your remaining bonus action to attack with a Spiritual Weapon. 

However, you may not attack twice with a Spiritual Weapon because this uses two bonus actions from the same spell, even if you attack with two separate castings of the spell, or if one bonus action was used to attack with an existing Spiritual Weapon while the other was used to cast a new Spiritual Weapon.
\end{DndComment}

\subsection{Combat Options}
Besides the standard options like Dash and Shove, you can use Disarm, Shove Aside, Climb Onto, Overrun and Tumble (DMG, 271-272). 

For your convenience, a reference list of all combat options is provided in the Appendix \see{combat-options}.















\chapter{Clarifications}

\noindent These clarifications must be adhered to, but are rare enough in practice that \textit{reading} them is not mandatory.

\subsection{Feat Preclusions}
You cannot be a Fighter (Battlemaster) and have the Martial Adept feat.

You cannot have levels in the same class in which you have the Magic Initiate feat.

If such a conflict arises, you can change the offending feat.

\subsection{Spellcasting Feats}

\subsubsection{Minimum Level}
Before you can cast a spell granted by a feat, you must first reach the level at which a full caster can cast that level of spell.

\subsubsection{Learning Spells}
Ignore any wording in feats that says you "learn" a spell.

\begin{DndComment}{Example}
If you take the Magic Initiate feat, you can cast the chosen 1st level spell once per long rest, but you do not learn that spell, and therefore cannot cast it using spell slots.
\end{DndComment}

You can take a single flavour feat, or a matched pair of feats (e.g. 3A and 3B) from the Flavour Feats (Paired) table. Such a pair counts as a single flavour feat.
