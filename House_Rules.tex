Sage Advice, including errata, has precedence over all other sources. Unofficial rulings by Jeremy Crawford are used as guidelines.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% CHARACTERS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Characters}
You should use only 27-point buy (PH, 13) or one of the standard arrays listed below, to determine your base ability scores.

\begin{DndTable}[]{lcccccc}
    \textbf{Default} & 8 & 10 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 \\
    \textbf{Wide} & 6 & 8 & 12 & 13 & 15 & 16
\end{DndTable}

\subsubsection{Hit Points}
If you roll for hit points upon levelling up, you can reroll all natural 1s.

\subsubsection{Proficiency Bonus}
You can use the optional rules for proficiency dice (DMG, 263).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% RACES
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Races}

\subsubsection{Ability Score Increase}
If your race and subrace together give a +2 and +1 increase to two fixed ability scores, you may choose which receives the +2 bonus.

You can ignore any reduction to an ability score from a racial Ability Score Increase trait.

\begin{DndComment}{Examples}
High Elves can choose to start with +2 Dexterity and +1 Intelligence, or +1 Dexterity and +2 Intelligence. 

Humans, Mountain Dwarves, and Tritons gain no flexibility because they do not follow the +2/+1 format.

Changelings and Warforged gain no flexibility because their increases are not to fixed ability scores.
\end{DndComment}


\subsubsection{Dragonmarks} You should not use Dragonmarked races.

\subsubsection{Flight} Before 5th level, flying speeds granted by racial traits cannot hold you in the air between turns. Unless you have other means of staying aloft, you fall at the end of your turn.

\subsection{Kobold}
\textit{Replaces Ability Score Increase (VGM, 119).}

\subparagraph{Ability Score Increase} Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and choose one of Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma to increase by 1.

\subsection{Grung}
\textit{Amends Poisonous Skin (OGA, 4).}

\subparagraph{Poisonous Skin} The DC of both types of poison is 10 plus your proficiency bonus.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% CLASSES
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Classes}

\subsection{Multiclassing}
The optional multiclassing rules from the Player's Handbook (PH, 163) are in use.

\subsubsection{Ability Flexibility}
When multiclassing into Barbarian, Paladin or Ranger, you may use Strength in place of Dexterity and vice versa.

\subsubsection{Hexblades}
You cannot multiclass with a Hexblade Warlock.

\subsection{Monk}

\subsubsection{Martial Arts}
\textit{Amends Monk table, Martial Arts column (PH, 77).}

Your Martial Arts die starts as 1d4. It increases to 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 9th level, 1d10 at 13th level, and 1d12 at 17th level.



\subsection{Ranger}

You may choose one of these two variations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Original Ranger (PH, 89)
    \item Revised Ranger (UARR, 1)

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sorcerer}

\subsubsection{Font of Magic}
\textit{Amends Font of Magic (PH, 101).}

You can spend sorcery points to \textit{regain} one expended spell slot as a bonus action on your turn (rather than \textit{creating} one).

\subsubsection{Extended Spell}
\textit{Replaces Extended Spell (PH, 102).}

When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, or while such a spell you have cast has not ended, you can spend 1 sorcery point to extend its duration by an amount equal to the spell's normal duration, to a maximum of 24 hours. You can do this only once per spell. This Metamagic option cannot be used with any other Metamagic option.

\subsubsection{Bonus Metamagic}
At 3rd level, you can learn either the Distant Spell or Extended Spell Metamagic options (PH, 102), in addition to the two you normally choose at this level.

\subsubsection{Wild Magic Surge}
\textit{Amends Wild Magic Surge table (PH, 104).}

\begin{DndTable}[]{lX}
    \textbf{d100} & \textbf{Effect} \\
    27-28 & For the next minute, all your spells with a casting time of 1 action can also be cast using 1 bonus action.
\end{DndTable}

\subsection{Warlock}

You can use Intelligence-based warlocks. If you do, all your warlock features based on Charisma, including your saving throw proficiency, change to use Intelligence instead.

Intelligence and Charisma are both considered warlock spellcasting abilities for the purposes of features like the Magic Initiate feat.

\subsection{Wizard}

\subsubsection{Portent}
\textit{Amends Portent (PH, 116).}

After you have used your Portent feature to replace a roll, that roll can no longer be rerolled or replaced by any feature, including Portent.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% FEATS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Feats}
The optional feat rules from the Player's Handbook (PH, 165) are in use.

\subsection{Changes to Prerequisites}

\paragraph{Grappler} (PH, 167) You no longer need a Strength score of 13 or higher.

\paragraph{Ritual Caster} (PH, 169) You no longer need an Intelligence or Wisdom score of 13 or higher.

\paragraph{Magic Initiate, Ritual Caster, Spell Sniper} (PH, 168-170) You need 11 points or more in the spellcasting ability you choose.

\subsection{Spellcasting Feats}

\subsubsection{Minimum Level}
When you take a feat that grants the ability to cast a spell, you cannot cast it using the feat until you reach the level at which a full caster would normally be able to cast the spell.

\subsubsection{Learning Spells}
Ignore any wording in feats that says you learn a spell. This overrules Sage Advice (SA2.4, 8).

\begin{DndComment}{Example}
If you take the Magic Initiate feat, you can cast the chosen 1st level spell once per long rest, but you do not learn that spell, and consequently cannot cast it using spell slots.
\end{DndComment}


\subsection{Feat: GWM/SS}
\textit{Amends Great Weapon Master (PH, 167) and Sharpshooter (PH, 170).}

The final benefits of the Great Weapon Master and Sharpshooter feats instead offer the option of a penalty equal to your proficiency bonus to attacks, in exchange for a bonus of twice your proficiency to damage.

\subsection{Feat: Lucky}
\textit{Amends Lucky (PH, 167).}

When you use a luck point, roll one additional d20. You can choose to replace one d20 from the original roll with this new d20 roll.

\subsection{Bonus Feats}
At character levels 1, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19, you can take a bonus feat from the Bonus Feats (Single) table, or a pair of feats from the Bonus Feats (Pair) table. You do not benefit from ability score increases from feats taken in this way.

\end{figure}

\section{Combat}

\subsection{Actions}
When you take an action in combat (PH, 192), you can use actions from the Actions in Combat table. 

In particular, you should not use the Mark action (DMG, 271).

\subsection{Action: Take a Bonus Action}
\label{takeABonusAction}
You can use your action to take a bonus action, but you cannot take bonus actions from the same feature more than once in a turn. This overrules Sage Advice (SA2.4, 10).

The modified rules on bonus action casting (pg.\pageref{bonusActionSpells}) also apply to spells cast using this action.

\begin{DndComment}{Example}
You can use your action to cast Healing Word with a bonus action, and then use your regular bonus action to attack with a Spiritual Weapon. 

However, you may not attack twice with a Spiritual Weapon because this uses two bonus actions from the same spell, even if you attack with two separate castings of the spell, or if one bonus action was used to attack with an existing Spiritual Weapon while the second bonus action was used to cast a new Spiritual Weapon.
\end{DndComment}

\subsection{Cover}
Ranged attacks through Medium-sized or smaller openings have half or three-quarters cover (as determined by the DM), unless the attacker is within 5 feet of the opening.

\subsection{Falling Unconscious}
If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious and gain one level of exhaustion.







%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% SPELLCASTING
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Spellcasting}

\subsubsection{Bonus Action Spells}
\label{bonusActionSpells}
\textit{Replaces Casting Time: Bonus Action (PH, 202).}

A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell. You can't cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.

\subsubsection{Counterspell and Dispel Magic}
You gain a +1 to the ability check for each level upcast.

\subsubsection{Identifying Spells}
Once per turn, you can perform an arcana check to identify a spell being cast. The DC is 10 + the spell's level.


\subsubsection{Targeting}
Spells that target creatures can also target objects where reasonable, as determined by the DM. This overrules Sage Advice (SA2.4, 13).




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% MISCELLANEOUS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Miscellaneous}

\subsubsection{Critical Failure}
A critical failure occurs when you have disadvantage on an attack roll or ability check and roll two natural 1s.

\subsubsection{Help}
When you take the Help action to assist with an ability check in which you are not proficient, you must succeed on a DC10 check of the same type as part of your Help action. If you fail, your Help action has no effect.

\subsubsection{Improvised Weapons}
You can use an object as an improvised weapon in a combat only if no creature has used it as a weapon before initiative was rolled for the same combat. Improvised weapons have the statistics of the most similar simple weapon, as determined by the DM.

\subsubsection{Instant Advantage}
Features which instantly grant advantage on an attack roll, ability check or saving throw can also be used after seeing a roll but before knowing the outcome, to reroll one d20 from the original roll.

\subsubsection{Telepathy}
Speaking with a creature telepathically does not confer the ability to reply telepathically. This has precedent in Sage Advice (SA2.4, 6).

A creature receiving telepathic speech is aware that the speech is telepathic.
