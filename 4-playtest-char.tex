\section{Classes}

\subsection{Barbarian}

\subsubsection{Frenzy}
\textit{Replaces Berserker's Frenzy (PH, 49).}

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can attack one additional time whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.

\subsection{Monk}
\subsubsection{Stunning Strike}
\textit{Replaces Stunning Strike (PH, 79).}

Starting at 5th level, you have one use of this feature and can expend it on your turn to make all your unarmed strikes stunning strikes until the end of that turn. If a stunning strike hits a creature, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your ki save DC or be stunned until the end of your next turn. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain all expended uses. You gain a second use of this feature at 11th level and a third at 17th level. 

\subsection{Ranger}
You may use a Variant Ranger instead of the other variations.

A Variant Ranger is an Original Ranger amended with these features from Unearthed Arcana (UACV, 7-9):

\begin{itemize}
    \item Deft Explorer
    \item Favored Foe
    \item Fighting Style Options
    \item Ranger Spells
    \item Spellcasting Focus
    \item Primal Awareness
    \item Fade Away
    \item Ranger Companion Options
\end{itemize}

In particular, you should not use the Spell Versatility feature (UACV, 8).

You can also use the new Fighting Styles and the Martial Versatility feature (UACV, 12), but only through Variant Ranger class features.

\subsection{Warlock}

\subsubsection{Hexblade}
The Hex Warrior feature (XGE, 55) is removed from the Hexblade Patron and added to the Pact of the Blade (PH, 107).

You can multiclass with such a Hexblade Warlock.




\section{Feats}
\subsection{Medium Armor Master}

You gain this additional benefit when you take this feat (PH, 168):

\begin{itemize}
\item Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
\end{itemize}
